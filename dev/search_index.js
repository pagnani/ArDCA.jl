The entries a^m_i equal either one of the standard 20 amino acids, or the alignment gap . In total, we have q = 21 possible different symbols in D. The aim of unsupervised generative modeling is to earn a statistical model P(a_1dotsa_L) of (aligned) full-length sequences, which faithfully reflects the variability found in D: sequences belonging to the protein family of interest should have comparably high probabilities, unrelated sequences very small probabilities. Here we propose a computationally efficient approach based on autoregressive models.
